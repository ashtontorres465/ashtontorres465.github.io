### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, is my first on the list of favorite labs because all we were really doing was learning basics and not necessarily focusing too much on the coding aspect. I enjoyed this because I am like many a complete beginner and it made the introduction to the class appear very welcoming to those with no prior knowledge. We did learn some coding as well as how to read error messaes that we encountered during the lab. In this lab I learned how to use std::cout to print "Hello, World".

* Lab 2
    Lab 2, was another favorite of mine because we now started diving into coding more such as things like operators. The operators we learned were for addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction. It was all very comprehendable because we took things everyone already knew how to do which was basic math and convert it into a code. In this lab I learned how to properly use operators in c++.

* Lab 3
    Lab 3, we now started to build upon ideas we have already covered in the previous lab while also incorperating new things here as well. We were able to take what we learned from Lab 2 and build upon it to make a fucntion that could do math. We also learned how to take that function and make it so that it could be used in main. In this lab I learned to make calls to main.
